<h1> Hi i am Rishu Raj</h1>
<h3>Software developer</h3>
<p>  I am hardworking and dedicated to my role and my own professional development. I love a challenge and constantly set goals for myself to achieve, both in work and in my personal life.Developers are responsible for the performance of the product in all its aspects, and while they need to a have a range of technical abilities and be familiar with computer languages, their ability to think laterally and develop logical solutions to modular problems is central to their role. </p>
